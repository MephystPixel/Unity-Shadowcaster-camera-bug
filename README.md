# Shadowcaster bug
This repository is a minimal reproduction of a bug with the 2D Lighting system. 
Rotating the camera appears to cause shadowcasters to malfunction completely.

## Steps to reproduce:
1. Open project.
2. Press play.
3. Press Q or E to rotate the camera until the shadowcasters break, and the shadows disappear.
